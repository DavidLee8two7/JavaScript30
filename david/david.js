Introduction
My Own story from skillshare
Target the global market - do it in English and do something for koreans

“Now days consumers are smart. They look for smart and positive service providers what ever it is”
“Do what you say and what you represent. If you don’t do and believe in what you sell or saying. Then why would anyone else would believe you?”
“Keep ask yourself and judge yourself acturately. Ask people’s opinion of your potential	consumer for fair evaluation”
